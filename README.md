This small project is a practical demonstration of how to configure and utilize Django's powerful built-in logging framework. It allows you to trigger different server-side log levels directly from a simple webpage using AJAX.

## 🤔 Why is Logging Important?

Logging is absolutely crucial for understanding what your application is doing, especially once it's deployed outside of your local development environment.

* **Debugging:** When things go wrong, logs are your primary tool for tracing the execution flow and identifying the source of errors. 🐛
* **Monitoring:** Logs help you keep an eye on the health and performance of your application. You can track resource usage, response times, or specific events. 📈
* **Auditing & Security:** Logs can record important events, like user logins, failed attempts, or suspicious activity, which is vital for security monitoring and audits. 🛡️
* **Understanding User Behavior:** You can log user interactions or application flows to gain insights into how your application is being used.🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️

This project serves as a hands-on introduction to setting up logging in Django, helping you understand how messages flow from your code to their final destination! 👇

## 🧠 Logging Overview in Django (and Python)

The Python `logging` system (which Django uses) works based on a few core concepts:

1.  **Loggers:** These are like categories or channels for messages (e.g., `django` for Django's core messages, `myapp` for your application's messages, `myapp.views` for logs specifically from your views module). You get a logger instance by name using `logging.getLogger('some_name')`.
2.  **Levels:** Each log message has a severity level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL). Each logger and handler also has a level. A message must be at or above the logger's level to be processed by that logger, and at or above a handler's level to be processed by that handler.
3.  **Handlers:** These determine *where* a log message goes (e.g., console, file, email, external service).
4.  **Formatters:** These define *what* the log message looks like (timestamp, level name, message content, etc.).
5.  **Filters:** These provide additional criteria for whether a log record should be processed by a handler or logger.
6.  **Propagation:** Loggers exist in a hierarchy (e.g., `django.db.backends` is a child of `django`). Messages can "propagate" up this hierarchy to parent loggers and their handlers.

Your `settings.LOGGING` dictionary orchestrates how these components are set up and connected.

## ✨ Features ✨

* Configures Django's built-in `logging` framework. ⚙️
* Sets up console logging (DEBUG+) and file logging (`info.log`, INFO+) for the `django` logger. 📜📁
* Serves a simple HTML page using Django templates and static files. 📄🎨
* Includes basic CSS styling for log level buttons. 💅
* Uses JavaScript (Fetch API) to send AJAX POST requests to a Django view. 🔄
* The Django view triggers the corresponding server-side log level based on the request. 🔥
* Handles basic CSRF protection for the AJAX POST request. ✅
* Uses a `.env.local` file and environment variables for settings. 🔑🌿


## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SiandjaRemy/django-logging-demo.git
    cd Django Logging
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    * On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🔑 Configuration (`.env` file)

This project uses environment variables, often sourced from a `.env` file. The `.env.local` file content can be used as reference to configure settings like `SECRET_KEY` and `DEBUG`.

1.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    In the root directory of your project (the same directory as `manage.py`), create a file named `.env`.

2.  **Copy the content of `.env.local`:**
    Copy the content from `.env.local` to you `.env` file, then: 

    * Replace `'your_generated_secret_key_here'` with a unique, random string. You can generate one using Django's `startproject` or online tools.
    * Set `DEBUG=True` for development purposes.


## 🏃‍♀️ Running the Project

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.** ✨
2.  **Ensure your environment variables are loaded** (e.g., by sourcing `.env` or using a tool). 🌿
3.  **Apply migrations (if any, standard step):**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## 🧠 How It Works (Detailed Flow)

1.  When you navigate your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, the request is routed to the `index_view` in `myapp/views.py`.
2.  `index_view` uses `render` to process and return the `index.html` template located in your project's `templates` directory.
3.  The `{% load static %}` tag enables static file handling in the template. The `<link>` tag using `{% static 'css/styles.css' %}` generates the correct URL (`/static/css/styles.css`), which the development server (`runserver` with `DEBUG=True` and `STATICFILES_DIRS` configured) serves from your `static/css/styles.css` file. 🎨
4.  The HTML page displays buttons, each with a `data-level` attribute indicating the desired log level (debug, info, etc.).
5.  The embedded JavaScript attaches click event listeners to these buttons. 🖱️
6.  When a button is clicked, the JS reads its `data-level` and retrieves the `csrftoken` from the browser's cookies.
7.  It uses the `Workspace` API to send an asynchronous `POST` request to the `/log/` URL. The request includes the log level in a JSON body (`{"level": "..."}`) and the `X-CSRFToken` header for security. 🔒
8.  Django's URL router matches `/log/` and sends the request to the `log_message` view.
9.  The `log_message` view (`@require_POST`) receives the POST request, parses the JSON body (`json.loads(request.body)`) to extract the `level` string.
10. It gets the specific `django` logger instance (`logging.getLogger('django')`) which is configured in your `settings.LOGGING`.
11. It dynamically calls the `log()` method on the `django_logger` using the integer representation of the requested level (e.g., `logging.INFO` for "info"). 🔥
12. This log record then travels through the logging system based on your `settings.LOGGING`:
    * The message's level is checked against the `django` logger's level (`DEBUG`). Since `DEBUG` >= `DEBUG`, `INFO` >= `DEBUG`, `WARNING` >= `DEBUG`, etc., all triggered levels pass this first check. ✅
    * The logger sends the message to the `console` handler (level `DEBUG`). Messages from DEBUG up pass this handler's level check and are output to your terminal using the `simple` formatter. 💻
    * The logger also sends the message to the `file` handler (level `INFO`). Messages from INFO up pass this handler's level check and are written to `info.log` using the `verbose` formatter. DEBUG messages are filtered out here. 📝
    * `"propagate": True` on the `django` logger means the message is also passed up to the root logger (though with the default root logger config, it might not be displayed again unless the level is WARNING or higher).
13. The `log_message` view returns a `JsonResponse` (e.g., `{"status": "success", "level": "..."}`).
14. The JavaScript receives this response and updates the status message on the webpage, letting you know the log was triggered. ✨

## ✅ Testing

1.  Ensure the development server is running.
2.  Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.
3.  Have the terminal where you ran `runserver` visible.
4.  In your project's root directory, observe the `info.log` file (you might need to refresh or reopen it in your text editor).
5.  Click each of the colored buttons on the webpage.
6.  Observe:
    * **Terminal:** Output should appear for **all** levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) in the `simple` format.
    * **`info.log`:** Output should appear only for levels **INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL** in the `verbose` format. DEBUG messages will not be in the file.

Enjoy exploring Django's logging! 🎉
